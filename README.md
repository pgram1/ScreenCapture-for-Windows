# ScreenCapture-for-Windows

Easy FFmpeg screen capturing script for Windows. Make sure FFmpeg is in your windows `PATH`. Captures end up on your user's desktop.

Stop capturing by pressing `q`.

By default there's no audio capturing, you could change that by altering the commands of the script.

More info on commands [here](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Capture/Desktop).
